# `client`

This project is bootstrapped by [aurelia-cli](https://github.com/aurelia/cli).

For more information, go to https://aurelia.io

# pnpm
I found recently that [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) is an awesome package manager, please give it a shot on this project
simply run `pnpm install` (`npm i -g pnpm`)

# Developing
since we're rendering our app from the flask skeleton we will not be using the `run` command from aurelia, instead we will use

- `au build --watch`

and when we do any changes we can just press <kbd>F5</kbd>
